## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions and reflections on the 2025 AP Computer Science A Free Response Questions (FRQs). It includes code implementations, problem analyses, and insights I gained from preparing for and taking the exam.

## Exam Experience

In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science A exam:

- **My preparation strategy for the exam included:**  
  Regular practice with past FRQs, using AP Classroom videos, and working through review packets with peers. I also practiced timed coding to simulate test conditions.

- **The most challenging aspects of the exam were:**  
  Managing logic-heavy questions under time pressure and debugging without access to a compiler.

- **Time management techniques that worked well for me:**  
  I started with the questions I felt strongest in, kept a close eye on the clock, and left time at the end to review syntax and edge cases.

- **Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions:**  
  I broke each problem into smaller parts, identified what was being asked, and annotated or pseudo-coded before writing full implementations.

## Growth Opportunities

Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- **Topic/Concept 1:**  
  *ArrayList indexing and manipulation* — Need more fluency with edge cases and index management.

- **Topic/Concept 2:**  
  *Class interaction and object composition* — Practice designing multiple interrelated classes and constructors.

- **Programming practice:**  
  Focused repetition of FRQs involving 2D arrays, recursive methods, and simulations. Implement more small projects in pure Java.

## Future Goals

Moving forward, I plan to:

- **Continue exploring data structures** such as linked lists, stacks, and queues beyond the AP curriculum.
- **Build a personal Java project**, like a text-based game or scheduler app, to reinforce class design and file I/O.
- **Develop a study strategy** for future CS coursework by building a spaced repetition system for reviewing Java concepts and maintaining a coding journal.
